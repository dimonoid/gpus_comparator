# gpus_comparator

This is a simple tool to visually compare performance of different GPUs.

Quickly discards GPUs that offer a non-competitive performance for price.

Uses data from [tomshardware.com]() and [pcpartpicker.com]()

TODO: Fix [pcpartpicker.com]() unofficial API to get prices of the most recent GPUs,
as currently server returns obsolete data.
